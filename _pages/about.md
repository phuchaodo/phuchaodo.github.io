Hello, I am Do Phuc Hao. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am a PhD student at [the Bonch-Bruevich Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications](https://www.sut.ru/). My research interests encompass a wide spectrum, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), federated learning, edge computing, and algorithms.

My academic journey has led me to delve into the intricate world of computer science, with a particular focus on cutting-edge technologies. As a dedicated PhD student, I am passionately exploring the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence, striving to unravel their potential in reshaping how we perceive and interact with technology. I am also a member of the [NETSEC-ITDUT](https://netsec-it.dut.udn.vn/home) research group at my university in Vietnam, which focuses on networking, network security, and applying AI/ML.

My journey is guided by an insatiable curiosity for algorithms, the fundamental building blocks of computational tasks. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge that propels the tech industry forward, paving the way for smarter, more efficient systems that can revolutionize various aspects of our lives.
